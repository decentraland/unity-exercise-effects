# Battle Simulator - Effects

## Instructions
We have a battle simulator that allows two different teams to battle against each other. But we need some cool effects adding!

Please use your own creative licence to add a number of effects to the scene.

You must:

- Create a custom script to extend the Unity universal rendering pipeline to create an effect of your liking as a post-process
- Optimize the effect for performance and ensure it works well on WebGL and desktop(Win or Mac)

You are free to add anything you like, the more creative the better but some examples are listed below.

## Death Effects
1. On death units can show a "phase out".

## Laser Effects
1. Improved laser / shooting effects.

## Ground Effects
1. The effect on the ground could represent which unit is occupying the current location
2. The more units clustered in a location, the effect should be greater
3. This can represent how much "power" the team has in an area.

## Unit Info Hover
1. Hovering over unit could render an outline-style shader.
2. The shader could change colour depending on the unit health.
