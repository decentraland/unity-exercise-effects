# Battle Simulator - Effects

## Instructions
We have a battle simulator that allows two different teams to battle against each other. But we need some cool effects adding! ðŸ”¥

Please use your own creative licence to add minimum of 2 effects to the scene.

You must:

- Create one effect of your liking as a post-process extending the Unity universal rendering pipeline
- Optimize the effects for performance and ensure it works well on both WebGL and desktop platforms (Windows or Mac)

You are free to add anything you like, the more creative the better but here are some examples to get you started:

### Death Effects
1. On death units can show a "phase out".

### Laser Effects
1. Improved laser / shooting effects.

### Ground Effects
1. The effect on the ground could represent which unit is occupying the current location
2. The more units clustered in a location, the effect should be greater
3. This can represent how much "power" the team has in an area.

### Unit Info Hover
1. Hovering over unit could render an outline-style shader.
2. The shader could change colour depending on the unit health.

## Additional information
- It is possible to include Unity built-in packages and packages of the Unity Registry, but it is not possible to use
3rd party packages or assets coming from the Asset Store or other sources, except for animations (e.g.
DOTween), and already included in manifest.json

- You can modify any code in the project if you see any places which can be improved in example: optimizations
or architecture.

- During the review we will look at the code quality and implementation, as well as Unity integration and performance.
It's early prototype, but it's good to follow good practices

Good luck âœ¨
